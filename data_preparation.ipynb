       "\"To solve linear regression, you need to find the coefficients which minimize the sum of squared errors.\\nMatrix Algebra method: Let's say you have X, a matrix of features, and y, a vector with the values you want to predict. After going through the matrix algebra and minimization problem, you get this solution:\\nBut solving this requires you to find an inverse, which can be time-consuming, if not impossible. Luckily, there are methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR Decomposition that can reliably calculate this part  (called the pseudo-inverse) without actually needing to find an inverse. The popular python ML library sklearn uses SVD to solve least squares.\\nAlternative method: Gradient Descent. \\n\""
