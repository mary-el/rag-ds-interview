# Retrieval Augmented Generation System with Python, Elasticsearch & LLMs

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've developed a system that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data science learning and quizzing. My project aims at making complex topics more digestible through interactive dialogue.
I was preparing for a data scientist interview, so I've collected a lot of materials to study, but it was hard to navigate through it. I am intersted in LLMs, so I've created a Python project in which I use Retrieval Augmented Generation to help me. 

## Project Overview 
Inspired by the transformative potential LLMs have in understanding and generating human-like text responses from massive datasets, my project implements a RAG system to answer queries about Data Science concepts. This approach not only helps users learn efficiently but also keeps them engaged through quizzes!
